# App Updater Template

## Purpose

Just to confirm my thoughts on how a program can update its self on startup.

## How it should work

The update program starts first and check a given Github repository for a new release. If exists a new version, the updater overwrites the existing files for the main program with the ones in the repository. Finally, the update starts the main program and closes itself.

## Instalation

1. Copy this repository
2. Install the required libraries using Pip
3. ???
